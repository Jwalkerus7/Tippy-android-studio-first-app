# Tippy-android-studio-first-app

Excited to learn how to use Android Studio AND creating this handy Tip Calculator.
Used FreeCodeCamp by an Android Dev named Rahul.
This is publishable to the Google Play Store and will post a link when the app
comes available to download in the Play Store.
Growing this app over time and making it my own in ways like little memos to the 
app user within the app is the goal. Something like inspirational quotes, Bible 
quotes, music quotes, etc.... 

Finished Tutorial and app 01-09-2022. 
This was my first experience with the Kotlin language, Android Studio, and anything 
to do with Android development. 
Building the app was fun and next on the TODO lsit is download it to the Google Play
Store.
